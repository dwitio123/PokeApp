# PokeApp

PokeApp is a Flutter-based mobile application that I created. This app is similar to a Pokédex, allowing users to view a list of Pokémon. Each Pokémon has detailed information displayed, including stats and abilities. In addition, users can compare the abilities between Pokémon. The app uses data from the PokeAPI.
